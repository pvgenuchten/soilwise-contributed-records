A repository to maintain a set of records contributed by SoilWise stakeholders.
The records in this repository are published in the catalogue at dayly intervals.

- Metadata Control Format in a YAML serialisation


## The SoilWise project

The SoilWise project will provide an integrated and actionable access point to scattered and heterogeneous soil data and knowledge in Europe, making them FAIR 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and improve trust, willingness, and ability to share and re-use soil data and knowledge. In three 
project development cycles, co-creation and co-validation by multi-stakeholder groups are the centre of project activities. SoilWise recognises existing 
workflows and repositories for specific user needs and aims to work with them to enhance their discoverability, approachability and interconnection. 
An open, modular, scalable and extensible knowledge and data repository building on existing and new technologies will be provided while respecting 
data ownership, access policies and privacy. AI- and ML- techniques will be employed to interlink scattered data and knowledge, automatise the processes, 
infer new knowledge and increase FAIRness. 
SoilWise applies infrastructure thinking instead of project thinking to design a repository for at least a decade to support EUSO evolvement accordingly.
